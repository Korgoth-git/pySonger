                    Hotel California

Hm                         F#                 F#7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                              E
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
G                            D
  Up ahead in a distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
  My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
F#                           F#7
  I had to stop for the night

Hm
  There she stood in the doorway
F#                     F#7
  I heard the mission bell
A
  And I was thinking to myself,
                  E
  'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
G                                    D
  Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em
  There were voices down the corridor,
F#
  I thought I heard them say...

G                           D
  Welcome to the Hotel California
          F#                   F#7                  Hm
  Such a lovely place (such a lovely place, such a lovely place)
G                                      D
  Plenty of the room at the Hotel California
       Em                                       F#          F#7
  Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here

  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mersedes bends
  She got a lot pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
  How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat,
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

  So I called up the Captain,
  'Please bring me my wine'
  He said, 'We haven't had that spirit
           here since nineteen sixty nine'
  And still those voices are calling from far away,
  Wake you up in the middle of the night
  Just to hear them say...

  Welcome to the Hotel Califonia
  Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
  They livin'it up at the Hotel California
  What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

  Mirrors on the ceiling,
  The pink champagne on ice
  And she said 'We are all just prisoners here,
               of our own device'
  And in the master's chambers,
  They gathered for the feast
  They stab it with their steely knives,
  But they just can't kill the beast

  Last thing I remember, I was
  Running for the door
  I had to find the passage back
  To the place I was before
  'Relax', said the night man,
  'We are programmed to receive.
  You can check out any time you like,
          but you can never leave.'
